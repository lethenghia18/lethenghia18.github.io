                <p>I was born and raised in <span style="color: rgb(204, 102, 0);">Hà Nội, Việt Nam</span>. Throughout my childhood, I was fortunate enough to live in a loving family, who provide me and my siblings with so much love and opportunities. I grew up a happy and regular kid, attending fantastic public elementary school and middle school. In this period I found and nurtured my passion for solving math problems, reading history books and novels, and travelling around the beautiful country. I am also lucky to be surrounded by smart and caring friends, who are still stuck with me until today. </p>

        <div class="below">
            <p class="col-md-8">When I was 15, I attended <span style="color: rgb(204, 102, 0);">Phillips Exeter Academy</span> in Exeter, New Hampshire for high school. This was a remarkable journey for me, leaving me with a lot of important lessons, lasting memories, and compassionate friends along the way. Exeter taught me so much, from being more confident in my language ability to critically think about and question the world. At this place I also found my interest in writing, particularly writing about my own memories or about things that makes me think deeper and deeper into the wonders around me. This is possible because of the caring and passionate teachers who encourage me to think more critically, to speak up my mind, and to discover the unknowns in my writing. More importantly, Exeter gives me intelligent, well-rounded, and above all, compassionate friends, some became my best friends. I am forever grateful for all of what Exeter has given me.</p>
            <p class="col-md-8">During Exeter, I was introduced to computer science, and I soon became fascinated with <span style="color: rgb(204, 102, 0);">programming problems</span>, more so that math. Therefore, I want to study Computer Science more in depth, and enrolled in <span style="color: rgb(204, 102, 0);">Carnegie Mellon University</span> as a Computer Science Major. My first semester, I took an introductory CS course, 15-112, and it is one of the best courses I have ever taken. Not only it introduced me to the basics of CS, but also important skills in programming such as top-down design, MVC, and testing. From there I continue my journey through the world of CS, taking theory as well as system courses. I also became <span style="color: rgb(204, 102, 0);">Teaching Assistant to 15-112</span>, and it again taught me a whole lot. Not only it gives me an perspective on how the course works, but it also reinforces my understanding of the materials and finds nuances that I did not discover as a student. I am currently looking for a research opportunity. Although I am not sure what path I want to go in CS, I am optimistic that I'll find it at CMU.</p>
            <p class='col-md-8'> Outside of the classroom, I enjoy runnning, working out, and am a member of CMU MMA. I am an avid fan of Arsenal FC, supporting the club since its last Premier League title in 2004.</p>
