                        <p> An introductory course for computer systems from the programmer's point of view. This course covers bit representations of data, machine-level code, memory hierarchy, cache, signals and processes, memory allocation, network programming, and concurrency. </p>
                        <p> This is one of my favorite courses because it helps me understand the underlying systems of a computer from a person who knows nothing about how computer works. In this course I learned how to read assembly and made a cache simulator, a shell, an implementation of malloc, and a multi-threaded and cached proxy.</p>

                        <p>In high school, I was introduced to computer science, and I soon became fascinated by programming problems, more so that math. Therefore, I want to study Computer Science more in depth, and enrolled in Carnegie Mellon University as a Computer Science Major. My first semester, I took an introductory CS course, 15-112, and it is one of the best courses I have ever taken. Not only it introduced me to the basics of CS, but also important skills in programming such as top-down design, MVC, and testing. From there I continue my journey through the world of CS, taking theory as well as system courses. I also became Teaching Assistant to 15-112, and it again taught me a whole lot. Not only it gives me an perspective on how the course works, but it also reinforces my understanding of the materials and finds nuances that I did not discover as a student. I am currently looking for a research opportunity. Although I am not sure what path I want to go in CS, I am optimistic that I'll find it at CMU.</p>
                        <p> Outside of the classroom, I enjoy runnning, working out, and am a member of CMU MMA. I also participated in outdoor and indoor soccer intramurals </p>

                        <p>When I was 15, I attended Phillips Exeter Academy in Exeter, New Hampshire for high school. This was a remarkable journey for me, leaving me with a lot of important lessons, lasting memories, and compassionate friends along the way. Exeter taught me so much, from being more confident in my language ability to critically think about and question the world. At this place I also found my interest in writing, particularly writing about my own memories or about things that makes me think deeper and deeper into the wonders around me. This is possible because of the caring and passionate teachers who encourage me to think more critically, to speak up my mind, and to discover the unknowns in my writing. More importantly, Exeter gives me intelligent, well-rounded, and above all, compassionate friends, some became my best friends. I am forever grateful for all of what Exeter has given me.</p>

I was in a classroom with 60 other teenagers, and we grew up together for 4 years. We studied together and we played soccer together everyday. This is where I nurtured my interests in solving math problems and soccer. My close friends from middle school and I still get together whenever we can. Someone even became a very special person in my life. </p>
